            <p>Firstly i have to start with the basics and set my study goals. Knowing my objectives completes half the
                job.Once
                I know what I want, the next step is to prepare a weekly study timetable. Have to set a routine for
                everything.My timetable could include the time I should go to bed, the time I should have my meals, and
                most
                importantly the time I should spend on studies. There is no hard and fast rule and I should of course
                allow
                some
                flexibility depending on how things go. But establishing a routine is essential, and have to try to
                stick to
                my
                study timetable as best as I can.</p>
